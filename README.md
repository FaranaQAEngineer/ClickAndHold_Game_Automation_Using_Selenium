# ClickAndHold_Game_Automation_Using_Selenium
This project demonstrates automation of a "Click and Hold" game using Selenium WebDriver in Java. It accesses a test webpage designed for practicing click-and-hold mouse actions, and performs a sequence of holding and dragging tiles (A to B, C to D, etc.) using the Actions class.
